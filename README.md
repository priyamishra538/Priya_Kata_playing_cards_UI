# Kata Playing Cards
### User story
As a user, I want to have an interface where I can draw a random playing card, so I can play a card game called battle card.

### Acceptance criterias
For the below requirements you may use the "Deck of Cards API" you can find here: http://deckofcardsapi.com where you'll be able to read all the documentation.

On the user interface, we need to:
* Display two buttons: a "Reset deck" button and a "Draw a card" button
* The "Reset deck" button, once pressed, will let the user to generate a **new shuffled deck** (see API)
* The "Draw a card" button, once pressed, will let the user to draw a single card from the generated deck above (see API)
* The picture of the card should be displayed on the user interface after pressing "Draw a card"
* If the deck is empty (52 cards being picked up), the "Draw a card" button should be disabled and a message should be displayed telling the user to reset the deck. The message should be: "The deck is empty, please reset the deck"

### To do
* Create a public repository on GitHub so you can share the link later on. You'll be able to push your code as long as you're progressing on this exercise
* Create a user interface in **Angular** answering the needs above. You are free to create your own design
